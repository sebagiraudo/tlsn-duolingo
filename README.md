Prove that you have a x day streak on Duolingo

Little project to learn how to use TLS Notary, trying to prove that you have certain streak on Duolingo.

I still need to check if it's possible. 

One way is to manually create the proof in the browser with certain request.

## Motivation
I have a running 1725 day streak on Duolingo. Whether it's the right tool for learning a language or not, it not expected to be thought now. I just enjoy a few minutes every day playing with this app and learning something. 

I was thinking that my streak is entirely in hands of Duolingo. If I want to show someone I have this streak I have to show them my Duolingo app or send them my user for them to check using their app. I want to try some idea of moving that data to blockchain so I can own it. It can also be possible to create some NFT that you had at some point a streak of x amount of days.

The complication is that the streak can be lost any day, so what I'm thinking is generating a proof that at a certain date you had a certain streak. 

I also want to take privacy into account. I use Duolingo with friends and family, but maybe I want to share my streak with someone I don't trust, without revealing my identity or any personal information.

It's still an open problem in my head how or where this could be used. But the thing is I love streaks, so having this data on chain would be amazing even if I can't use it anywhere. However, maybe there are some ideas, like being able to participate in some kind of chats only if you have a streak bigger than x, or comparing your streak with someone you don't know nor trust.


## Steps needed to build this project:
1. Check where to obtain data
2. Do some TLSN hello world. Evaluate if it's an appropriate tool
3. Create some proof generator
4. Create some proof verifier or check if I can use the one that already exists.
5. Deploy some app?

## Future work
* Find use cases with this data.
* Allow people to mint a NFT only if they have a streak bigger than X.
* Come up with a better name.
